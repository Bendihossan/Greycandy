				Rather than having a traditional photo blog, I post all my photos to flickr. So if you're interested in photography, fell free to add me and leave a comment!</p>

				At the moment I'm on an industrial year placement (part of my degree) working for the Aberystwyth University web team, using their CMS & writing XHTML, CSS &amp; PHP.</p>
				<p>However once I finish my degree I'll be looking for a job in the computer science industry. Interested? If so, contact me via email or on <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/steffanharries">LinkedIn</a> if you're on there.
