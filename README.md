DEPRECATED
=============
This was a theme for Silverstripe 2.x, now v3 is available and I don't have the time or the itch to scratch to maintain this.

If anyone wants to take over the project, let me know.

Description
-------------
This theme is a simple and minimal theme designed for use with Silverstripe 2.4 and greater.  It's written in CSS3 and uses a media queries to scale (for browsers that support it, a fallback stylesheet exists for IE7 and JavaScript for Media Query support). 
The theme is designed for small websites that need a basic theme from which to build upon and grow.
It has a dynamic sidebar with nested elements that grows on demand.

Installation
-------------
Put the Greycandy folder in a the /themes directory of your Silverstripe installation. Then login to your Silverstripe admin page and choose the theme from the dropdown box. Once you've done that just flush Silverstripe's cache by adding "?flush=1" to the end of your URI. If the theme doesn't work after than you probably have a permissions issue and there's plenty of Google results on how to fix that.

You may also wish to edit the Includes/Footer.ss file using your favourite text editor for some customisation. I don't required you to keep references to me or my site in the Footer file but I do appreciate it.

Problems?
-------------
Sent me an email! I welcome anyone who has pull requests that will improve the overall theme. You can also email me at contact@steffanharries.me.uk. Please try to include as much information as you can about the problem as well as any suggested fixes you have.
